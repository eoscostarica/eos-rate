  "about": {
    "tabTitle": "About EOS Rate Block Producer Ratings and EOS voting tool",
    "title": "EOS RATE: A RATING SYSTEM FOR THE EOS MAINNET",
    "subtitle1": "What is the EOS Mainnet?",
    "body1": {
      "paragraph1": "If you belong to the EOSIO community – or have read something about the EOSIO blockchain – you might have heard of the EOS Mainnet. The EOS Mainnet is the main network of the EOSIO blockchain’s platform where transactions take place. Also, if you’re reading this, it’s highly probable that you know the terminology of blockchain.",
      "paragraph2": "Further, EOSIO uses a native consensus mechanism known as “Delegated Proof-of-Stake” (DPoS), developed by Daniel Larimer. DPoS in EOSIO uses an election process where EOS token holders vote for the Block Producers (BPs) they think are the most qualified to be the custodians of the network. The EOS Mainnet runs with the twenty-one BPs that obtain the most votes.",
      "paragraph3": "So, the DPoS mechanism requires these twenty-one elected nodes to produce the blocks, and, in exchange, they can receive rewards. One of the underlying opportunities of EOSIO by using DPoS is the ability to scale. Hence, DPoS allows Block Producers to reach consensus faster than traditional PoW (Proof-of-Work) or PoS (Proof-of-Stake) mechanisms. For instance, this enables EOS nodes to validate up to 4,000 transactions per second, in comparison to Ethereum that can reach 15."
    },
    "subtitle2": "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility",
    "body2": {
      "paragraph1": "Nonetheless, people in the EOS community claim that both DPoS and the EOS Mainnet may be having some drawbacks, including more centralization in a network that’s supposed to be decentralized. For example, in one case, some accounts were frozen by BPs, which raised people’s eyebrows in the community. Also, there have been some disagreements associated with performance degradation in the network.",
      "paragraph2": "Consequently, token holders who elect the twenty-one nodes can only trust the transparency and democracy of the EOS Mainnet. Thus, these BPs are the ones who must protect and keep the mainnet up and running in the best interests of the voting community.",
      "paragraph3": "As of now, it’s only possible to keep track of rankings according to votes by token holders. However, the weight of token holders’ votes is determined by the number of EOS tokens they possess, meaning that token holders with more EOS can cast a more weighted vote for the BPs they want to endorse. In other words, those who have fewer EOS tokens may seem underrepresented. So, the importance of maintaining a transparent and trustworthy election process in the EOS Mainnet is what brought to life the idea of the open-source app called EOS Rate."
    },
    "subtitle3": "What Is EOS Rate?",
    "body3": {
      "paragraph1": "EOS Rate is an open-source, decentralized app (Dapp) built by a team of developers in Costa Rica. It allows EOS token holders to access a rating system and voting portal for BPs and Proxies, making it easier for the token holders to make an informed decision.",
      "paragraph2": "Moreover, EOS Rate intends to gather global ratings to help capture collective opinion, or “wisdom of the crowd,” and measure if the voting patterns reflect voter sentiment. Then, the Dapp generates profile pages of the BPs, using a radial component called “LEAF” (Liquid EOS Attribute Factores) to help the users visually compare the most relevant qualitative attributes of BPs.",
      "paragraph3": "So, to submit ratings, the token holders must sign in with their EOS wallet, making the voting process more secure and transparent. This means that one account can only represent one rating submission per BP. Then, the ratings are securely stored in the EOS blockchain to guarantee the immutability of the ratings.",
      "paragraph4": "In addition, token holders can submit their rating in EOS Rate using five distinct categories:",
      "paragraph5": "In particular, once a token holder submits his or her ratings, the total of the ratings will be displayed as radial graphs. So, the process of EOS Rate would be something like this:"
