Each EOS account can submit their rating for each Block Producer as many times as they like facilitating a \"liquid democracy\", however, the weighting is independent from the amount the EOS account holds. One account = one submission of equal weight. EOS Rate does not influence the account of the ratings, just present the facts in a visually appealing format.",

The LEAF also allows voters to compare different proxies by visualizing each of the underlying BP \"leafs\" the proxy represents."
