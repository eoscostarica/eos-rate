        "text1": "EOS Rate is an open-source Dapp that allows EOS token holders to rate Block Producers (BPs) and Proxies in just a few clicks. Users can access a rating system and voting portal, making it easer for the token holders to make a informer decision.",
        "text2": "Moreover, EOS Rate intends to gather global ratings to help capture collective opinion, or \"wisdom on the crowd\" and measure if the voting patterns reflect voter sentiment. The Dapp generates profile pages of the BPs, using a radial component called \"LEAF\" (Liquid EOS Attribute Factors) to help the user visually compate the most relevant qualitative attributes of BPs.",
        "subtitle2": "How Does EOS Rate Work?",
        "text3": "To submit ratings, the token holders must sing in with their EOS wallet. This means that one account can only represent one rating submission per BP. The ratings are securely stored in the EOS blockchain ti guarantee the immutability of the ratings.",
        "text4": "Right now, we are looking for token holders who want to become beta testers! EOS Rate beta version is currently running in the EOS Mainnet."
