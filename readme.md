# A Rating Portal for the EOS Community

EOS Rate is a community-driven visual rating tool that allows EOS token holders to easily rate Block Producers in distinct categories.

The rating system is based on a radial graph representing the most important qualitative aspects (let’s call them categories) of a block producer, populated with ratings provided by the input if the EOS community, and stored on the blockchain.

It will also provide basic quantitative information, a compare tool, dynamic filtering and links related to each BP (block producer), in order to fully inform the potential voter, but also let them share their ratings.

Each EOS account can submit their rating for each BP as many times as they like facilitating a "liquid democracy", however, the weighting is independent from the amount the EOS account holds. One account = one submission of equal weight.

## Test Environment

We are testing this application on the [Jungle TestNet](https://jungletestnet.io). The Smart Contract is code deployed under the account [rateproducer](https://jungle.bloks.io/account/rateproducer).

The `staging` branch contains our test environment. This UI is currently available at https://jungle.eosrate.io:8080  
  
We are running the application infrastructure on premises in San Jose, Costa Rica.

</p>

## App Services

- **webapp:** http://localhost:3000  
  A React JS Web Client based on create-react-app that starts up at the available port (default is 3000).

- **[hasura](https://hasura.io)** http://localhost:8088  
  Autogenerated GraphQL API based on the PostgresDB Schema.
  Run `make hasura` to start the management console.

- **pgweb:** http://localhost:8082  
  Web-based PostgreSQL database browser written in Go running on a linux alpine container.

- **demux:**
  Deterministic event-sourced state and side effect handling for blockchain applications. Updates ratings stats in postgres when new ratings are detected on the blockchain.

- **hapi:**
  A back end service for synchronizing `rateproducer` blockchain tables with postgreSQL.

- **EOSIO Node:** https://eos.edenia.cloud
  <br/>[`fill-pg`](https://github.com/EOSIO/history-tools#fill-pg) fills postgresql with data from nodeos's State History Plugin.

_Note: This project is based on [EOS DApp Boilerplate](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-dapp-boilerplate)._

## Development Setup

Basic knowledge about Docker, Docker Compose, EOSIO and NodeJS is required.

- Video tutorial [Docker Containers | Learn Docker Basics in 30 Mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kwXLcwUw0Q)

### Install Global Dependencies

- Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/.  
  At least 10GB RAM (Docker -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Memory -> 10GB or above)
- Hasura CLI https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html
- EOSIO Binaries https://github.com/eosio/eos.  
  This will allow you to `cleos` and `koesd` directly on host machine.
- EOSIO.CDT https://github.com/eosio/eosio.cdt.  
  This will allow you to compile the contracts directly on host machine.

### Run EOS Rate on your Computer

```
git clone git@github.com:eoscostarica/eos-rate.git
cd eos-rate
make dev
```
